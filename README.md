Full screen card view for Trello
===============

Full screen card view for Trello - Chrome and user script extension.

Slightly modified to change the width to be 75% instead of full width.

### About

Makes the card and edit window in Trello.com full screen

Converts the small Trello card view/edit windows to be full screen height and width.

If you use trello.com a lot like myself, and add lots (pages) of information in the card description section youâ€™ll find the small card window a real pain to use.

To fix this I whipped up a quick chrome extension to make the card edit window full screen.
